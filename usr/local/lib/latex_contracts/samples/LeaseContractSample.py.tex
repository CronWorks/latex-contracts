    \section{Terms of Lease Agreement}
        \clause[Primary Tenant]{TEST: B0rKD the first clause!
    ALSO: Please confirm that the next clause is NOT "Occupation Type"!!!}
\clause[Security Deposit]{To confirm this Agreement, Tenant will make a payment to Lessor
            in the amount of \highlight{\$1,000.00} as a combined
            Security Deposit and move-in fee within 
            \highlight{7} days of the Lease Agreement
            Date.
        Of this amount,
        \highlight{\$250.00} is a
        non-refundable move-in fee, and the
        remaining portion is a security for performance of Tenant's obligations as described in this
        Agreement, including but not limited to payment of rent and cleaning of the Property for which
        Tenant is responsible, and to indemnify Lessor for damage to the Property. If any such damage
        occurs beyond the refundable portion, then the Tenant will be responsible for the difference.
        Values of damages will be based on reasonable market value of any incurred repairs, 
        replacement, or services.
        This deposit will be held in an account at World Trust Federal Bank in 
        Springfield, NA.}
\clause[Rent]{The rent is \highlight{\$1,505.00} per month,
        payable on or before the first of each month commencing on the first month of the lease term. 
        If the Tenant moves in on a date other than the first of the month, then a pro-rated amount for
        the remaining portion of the first month plus one month's rent will be due upon occupation of the
        Property.}
\clause[Rent Late Charge/NSF Check]{If any rent is not paid on or before the due date plus a
        \highlight{5} day grace period, Tenant
        agrees to pay a late charge of
        \highlight{\$25.00} for each day the payment
        is delinquent after the last day of the grace period, up to a
        maximum of \highlight{10\%} of one
        month's rent.
        
        Tenant agrees to pay a charge of
        \highlight{\$50.00} for each
        Non-Sufficient Funds (NSF) check given by Tenant to Lessor. Lessor
        shall have no obligation to redeposit any check returned NSF.
        Lessor may elect to terminate this Agreement for nonpayment of
        rent, including checks returned NSF. Lessor shall notify Tenant of
        late rent and NSF check charges, and charges must be paid within
        \highlight{5} days.}
\clause[Utilities]{The rent includes reasonable use of:
            \highlight{Water/Sewer/Garbage}.
            Tenant shall pay all other utilities owed when due.}
\clause[Inspection Agreements]{Before moving in, the move-in inspection 
            agreement included in this Agreement (section \ref{moveInInspection})
            will be filled out by Lessor and
            Tenant, and initialed on the bottom of each page. Spaces left blank indicate items
            in good condition and general cleanliness. Each party's initials indicate acknowledgement
            that the state of the property is as documented, and binds each initialed 
            page to this Agreement by the terms
            stated here. 
            Within \highlight{7} days of occupation of the Property, 
            if any item differs noticeably from its condition
            as documented in section \ref{moveInInspection}, Tenant will notify Lessor and
            section \ref{moveInInspection} will be modified and re-initialed as appropriate.
            
        Upon vacation or abandonment of Property, Lessor and Tenant will fill out
        the move-out inspection (section \ref{moveOutInspection}). Spaces left blank indicate items
        in good condition and general cleanliness.
        Any items that differ from their move-in state beyond normal wear and tear shall be
        considered damaged and the value of damages withheld from the Security Deposit
        (clause \ref{Security Deposit}).
    
        Within \highlight{7} days of the Tenant's move-out date,
        Lessor will give Tenant a statement of
        the basis of retaining any of the Deposit, and the remaining balance between the Lessor and Tenant
        will be paid by a method mutually agreed upon between them within 
        \highlight{14} days of the move-out date.}
\clause[Possession]{Tenant may take possession of the property starting at \highlight{2:00pm}
            on the Occupation Date. Before taking possession, Tenant must have paid the first Rent payment
            as defined in clause \ref{Rent}, and the payment transaction must be cleared for withdrawal 
            by the Lessor's bank.
            In the event Tenant fails to take possession of the Property within
            \highlight{7} days of the Occupation Date, Tenant will forfeit the 
            Security Deposit and this Agreement will become void. If, through no fault of Lessor, Lessor
            cannot deliver possession of the Property to Tenant on the Occupation Date, Lessor shall
            not be liable to Tenant for damages. In this case, rent charges will accrue starting on the date
            possession is taken, unless otherwise agreed upon in writing.}
\clause[Authorized Occupants]{The property is being rented as a private residence only for the Tenant and
            Additional Occupants listed in this Agreement, plus any additional occupant(s) chosen at
            the discretion of the Tenant up to a maximum of 
            \highlight{2} total occupants.
        The Tenant shall not assign this Agreement,
        sublet all or any portion of the Property, nor give accommodation to any other roomers or
        lodgers, without the prior written consent of the Lessor. Additional occupants may be approved,
        but this may also increase the monthly rent amount. All occupants are bound by the same terms
        as the Tenant.}
\clause[Furniture]{The property is being rented as a \textbf{Furnished} residence, and it is the tenant's
            responsibility to protect the included furniture against abnormal wear and tear.
        It is the tenant's responsibility to protect the walls and floors from damage when moving
        furniture.}
\clause[Maintenance]{Upon termination of this agreement, Tenant will leave the Property in as good
        condition as it is now, reasonable wear and tear excepted. Tenant agrees not to make any
        alterations or improvements to the Property without Lessor's prior written approval.}
\clause[Entry/Inspection/Maintenance/Sale]{Lessor may enter the Property to inspect it, make
        alterations or repairs, or show it to potential renters or buyers at reasonable times and, except in
        emergencies, will give 24 hours' notice to Tenant before entering.}
\clause[Agents]{Lessor may have others (``Agents'') act as their
        representatives for the purposes of executing portions of this Agreement, including 
        interacting with the Tenant, performing inspections and/or maintenance, 
        and enforcing terms of the Agreement. Lessor will notify the Tenant and identify any such 
        Agent before the Agent visits the Property or
        otherwise makes contact with the Tenant. Without this notice, other parties should 
        not be considered to have any special privileges.}
\clause[Termination]{This is a fixed-length lease, and the Termination Date is defined by the
            Lease End Date (definition \ref{Lease End Date}).    
        If not signing another subsequent lease for the same property,
        Tenant is instructed to move out by \highlight{12:00pm (noon)} on the 
        Termination Date at the latest. Upon termination of this Agreement, 
        any remaining financial obligations of
        Lessor or Tenant as defined by the Agreement remain intact and payable.}
\clause[Attorney's Fees]{If at any time it becomes necessary for Lessor or
        Tenant to employ an attorney to enforce any terms of this Agreement, the prevailing party is
        entitled to reasonable attorneys' fees as provided for by law. In the event of a trial, the amount
        shall be as fixed by the Court.}
\clause[Waiver of Subrogation]{Lessor and Tenant hereby release and waive, for the duration of
        this Agreement and any extension or renewal thereof, their respective rights of recovery against
        each other for any loss resulting from perils of fire and/or extended coverage as defined in
        fire insurance policies issued to either Lessor or Tenant in effect at the time of loss,
        provided that such waiver and resale shall apply only in the event such agreement does not
        prejudice the insurance afforded by such policies.}
\clause[Personal Property]{Tenant agrees that all personal property kept in or on the Property is at
        the risk of the Tenant. Tenant is specifically advised of the availability of Renters' Insurance,
        and is encouraged to obtain insurance for such personal property.}
\clause[Smoke Detector]{Tenant acknowledges and Lessor certifies that the Property is equipped with
        a smoke detector(s) as required by RCW 43.44.110.
        
        
            The detector(s) will be tested during the
            Move-In Inspection (section \ref{moveInInspection}), and any non-operational detectors will
            be repaired or replaced.  
        It is Tenant's responsibility to maintain the smoke detector(s) as specified by
        the manufacturer, including replacement of batteries, if required. Failure to properly maintain the
        smoke detector(s) can result in punishment including a fine pursuant to
        RCW 43.44.110.}

        }

        \clause[Garbage]{Tenant shall furnish garbage can(s) if not supplied by garbage
        collection company, and place it/them where necessary for collection, or shall deliver garbage
        to collection bins if Property is part of a multi-unit building and garbage is collected
